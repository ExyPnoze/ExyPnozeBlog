      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;Who am I?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Léandre. I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in all things cybersecurity, especially malware, digital forensics and incident response. Outside of this field, I’m a quick learner who stays calm under pressure and loves adding a touch of humor to everyday life. Though I can be a bit shy at first, I’m straightforward and always ready for an honest conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-this-blog-about&#34;&gt;What is this blog about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is a space where I share pieces of my journey, both personal and professional. It’s about cybersecurity, of course, but it’s also about everything and nothing—random thoughts, stories from my teaching experience, lessons from books, and some fun thoughts (like my jealousy of someone’s blue hair!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This blog is a space where I share pieces of my journey, both personal and professional. It’s about cybersecurity, of course, but it’s also about everything and nothing—random thoughts, stories from my teaching experience, lessons from books, and some fun thoughts (like my jealousy of someone’s blue hair!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s who I am: a mix of technical passion, curiosity, and a love for connecting with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-did-i-create-this-blog&#34;&gt;Why did I create this blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created this blog to share my journey, ideas and connect with like-minded people. Writing helps me think and sharing it helps others understand me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to learn something new, share a laugh, or just get to know me a bit better, I hope you enjoy your time here. Welcome to my little corner of the internet!&lt;/p&gt;
